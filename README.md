Introduction:
A geo-modeling framework based on SpatioTemporal LSTM framework. 

We thank to the codes and core idea provided by Wang, Y., Wu, H., Zhang, J., Gao, Z., Wang, J., Philip, S. Y., & Long, M. (2022). Predrnn: A recurrent neural network for spatiotemporal predictive learning. IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence, 45(2), 2208-2225. The code herein we mainly referred is at the link: https://github.com/thuml/predrnn-pytorch

Preparation:
Before running the program, we suggest to prepare the environment with Python 3.9, PyTorch 1.10.1, NumPy 1.23.5 and SciPy 1.9.3

For running the program, you can firstly download the project and then prepare the dataset, and these training samples will be saved in the document called xxx, finally, you can start run.py to train the network

The original dataset including both porous media sandstone and continuous fold structrual model are given at this link.

The hyperparameter settings are included in run.py.
